Tool execution flow
====================

Postcode editor
---------------
There are two ways program execution can go in the postcode editor window. Either the user decides to request information about already 
existing networks via a numerical ID or they draw a shape on the map to generate a new grid of networks.

If the user decides to create a new grid via area selection, the sequence will continue the same way as with network selection via ID once the user
has decided to generate the new networks.
